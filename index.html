          <h2>About Me</h2>

          <p>
            I'm a proud Guatemalan and a senior undergraduate in Industrial Engineering and
            Operations Research at the University of California, Berkeley. I'm especially interested
            in research related to transportation and mobility systems, including optimizing routing
            problems, and I enjoy modeling and simulating matching and queueing problems that arise
            in real-world operational settings. Much of my work focuses on understanding how
            algorithms, data, and system structure interact to shape performance.
          </p>

          <p>
            I currently work as a Data Fellow at Berkeley's Center for Educational Partnerships,
            where I support data analytics projects that inform educational access, outreach, and
            program evaluation across campus initiatives.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm a member of the student chapter of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (<a
              href="https://ite.studentorg.berkeley.edu/"
              >Cal ITE</a
            >) and serve on the Operations Subteam for the
            <a href="https://transpo.studentorg.berkeley.edu/"
              >Cal ASCE Transportation Competition Team</a
            >, where I collaborate on projects related to transportation planning and operations.
          </p>

          <p>
            My academic interests include vehicle routing, last-mile logistics, large-scale
            optimization, and machine learning applications, but I'm flexible and curious about
            applying these tools to other problem domains. I have a strong appreciation for
            computational organization and reproducibility, and I make a point to keep my work
            well-structured, clearly documented, and version controlled.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also enjoy teaching and mentoring, and I believe that teaching is just as valuable for
            learning as it is for sharing knowledge. I like breaking down complex ideas into
            intuitive components and helping others build confidence with technical material.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of academics, I'm an advocate for autism awareness, inspired by my younger
            brother. I also enjoy playing guitar and piano, emphasizing R&B, smooth jazz, and
            ballads; anything that is calm and relaxed. I'm a big fan of soccer, have supported
            Borussia Dortmund since 2017 (<i>Heja BVB!</i>), and enjoy playing the sport as well.
