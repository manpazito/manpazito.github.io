          <!-- ABOUT ME SECTION -->
          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I’m a senior undergraduate in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at the
            University of California, Berkeley. I’m especially interested in transportation and
            mobility systems, and I enjoy modeling and simulating matching and queueing problems
            that arise in real-world operational settings. Much of my work focuses on understanding
            how algorithms, data, and system structure interact to shape performance.
          </p>

          <p>
            I currently work as a Data Fellow at Berkeley’s Center for Educational Partnerships,
            where I support data management projects that inform educational access, outreach, and
            program evaluation across campus initiatives.
          </p>

          <p>
            My academic interests include vehicle routing, last-mile logistics, and large-scale
            optimization, but I’m flexible and curious about applying these tools to other problem
            domains. I have a strong appreciation for computational organization and
            reproducibility, and I make a point to keep my work well-structured, clearly documented,
            and version controlled.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also enjoy teaching and mentoring, and I believe that teaching is just as valuable for
            learning as it is for sharing knowledge. I like breaking down complex ideas into
            intuitive components and helping others build confidence with technical material.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of academics, I’m an advocate for autism awareness, inspired by my younger
            brother. I’m also a multi-instrumentalist and enjoy playing both guitar and piano. I’m a
            big fan of soccer, have supported Borussia Dortmund since 2017 (Heja BVB!), and enjoy
            playing the sport as well.
          </p>
