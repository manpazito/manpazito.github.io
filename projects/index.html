        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          I’m a senior undergraduate in <b>Industrial Engineering and Operations Research</b> at the
          <b>University of California, Berkeley</b>. I’m especially interested in transportation and
          mobility systems, and I enjoy modeling and simulating matching and queueing problems that
          arise in real-world operational settings. Much of my work focuses on understanding how
          algorithms, data, and system structure interact to shape performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          I currently work as a <b>Data Fellow</b> at Berkeley’s
          <b>Center for Educational Partnerships</b>, where I support data analytics projects that
          inform educational access, outreach, and program evaluation across campus initiatives.
        </p>

        <p>
          My academic interests include vehicle routing, last-mile logistics, and large-scale
          optimization, but I’m flexible and curious about applying these tools to other problem
          domains. I have a strong appreciation for computational organization and reproducibility,
          and I make a point to keep my work well-structured, clearly documented, and version
          controlled.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also enjoy teaching and mentoring, and I believe that teaching is just as valuable for
          learning as it is for sharing knowledge. I like breaking down complex ideas into intuitive
          components and helping others build confidence with technical material.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of academics, I’m an advocate for autism awareness, inspired by my younger
          brother. I’m also a multi-instrumentalist and enjoy playing both guitar and piano. I’m a
          big fan of soccer, have supported Borussia Dortmund since 2017 (Heja BVB!), and enjoy
          playing the sport as well.
